            First of all, very happy birthday Dhana Sri 💖. <br>
        I just wanted to tell you how much you truly mean to me and how lucky I feel to have a friendship with you.
        .
         You are my comfort, my happiness. With you, everything feels a little lighter, a little calmer. Even on days when nothing makes sense, just talking to you somehow fixes things.

            You are beautiful—not just by the way you look, 
            but by the way you think and the way you carry yourself. 
            You’re intelligent, strong, and I really admire how you handle your own problems without giving up.
            That independence of yours is something I respect you so much. <br>
            And the friendship you carry… it’s rare. <br>

        <p>
            The way you talk, the way you understand, the way your words stay with me—whether they’re caring, motivating, or even those silly dirty jokes that somehow always make me laugh at the right time. Every version of you feels real, and that’s what makes our bond special.

            I’m grateful for every conversation, every laugh, every moment of support we’ve shared across the miles. On your birthday, I just hope you feel loved, appreciated, and reminded that somewhere out here, there’s someone who’s genuinely thankful for you being in their life.
            <b>And I promise to always be here for you, no matter what.</b> <br> <br>
